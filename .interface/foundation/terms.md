# Terms

This section defines the shared vocabulary used to understand Agent Interface, its Modules, its Foundation resources, and its operational Config records.

<br>

- **Interface** — the complete system described by this document; it contains the Target, Implementation, and Executor Modules together with Config, Understanding, Operations, Foundation Files, Modes, Authority, and Workflow.
- **Human** — the person who defines the Target and owns every authored Interface source.
- **Module** — a primary conceptual boundary with a distinct responsibility inside the Interface. Target, Implementation, and Executor are the Interface Modules.
- **Target** — the application, platform, service, API, module, package, subsystem, or other development subject the Interface works on. The term is preferred over Target Project because the subject does not have to be an entire project.
- **Implementation** — the implementation's reusable programming philosophy and engineering perspective, independent of a particular Target or Agent.
- **Agent** — an AI coding system or execution unit that interacts with the Interface and maps its concepts to native capabilities.
- **Foundation** — the shared resources required by the Modules and Skills, including Interface section files and Schemas; Config is a separate operational boundary.
- **Foundation File** — a Human-owned shared source that explains or supports the Interface without becoming a Module.
- **Component** — one named part of the Implementation or Executor Module perspective that owns a responsibility and is described through Principles together with Implementation Preferences or Executor Preferences; some Implementation Components also own operational records.
- **Implementation Module** — the Module that defines the reusable programming philosophy, Principles, Preferences, and Component composition applied to a Target.
- **Implementation Component** — one independent Component inside the Implementation Module with a defined responsibility, Public Interface, Principles, and Implementation Preferences.
- **Logic Component** — the reusable library Component that implements application Behavior and publishes a Public Logic Interface.
- **API Component** — the executable Component that starts the API process, owns transport concerns, and invokes Logic through its Public Interface.
- **Presentation Component** — the executable Component that presents the application to users and consumes the API Component.
- **Public Logic Interface** — the provider-owned public library surface through which API invokes application Behavior.
- **API Contract** — the public description of API operations, transport schemas, versions, and approved outcomes.
- **Technical Purpose** — a language-level use such as modeling, API delivery, database access, ORM, or migration that may be shared by compatible Components.
- **Principles** — mandatory portable philosophy, responsibilities, rules, and boundaries owned by an Implementation or Executor Component.
- **Implementation Preferences** — preferred engineering choices, defaults, packages, implementation conventions, and optional Agent Skill associations used when the Target leaves a choice unspecified.
- **Schema** — the structure a file follows: either a standard for a Human-authored file or an operational format and initial template for a generated record.
- **Config** — the separate shared operational boundary for mutable generated records that coordinate the Workflow; Config does not store what the Target means.
- **Config Record** — one generated operational file inside `.config/` at the project root.
- **Plan** — the high-level organization of work, containing Groups, dependencies, and individual Tasks.
- **Task** — one bounded, understandable, and verifiable unit of work within a Plan.
- **Understanding** — the current context an Agent Native or Agent Instance establishes from authoritative sources before performing a Skill's role; it may be Interface Understanding, Target Understanding, or Source Understanding.
- **Source Understanding** — the understanding of generated Source within the scope required by a role. It may cover one or more selected Development Components, such as Model, Database, Logic, API, or Presentation, without requiring all generated Source to be read.
- **Operation** — one defined action performed through an Agent Skill to configure, plan, develop, review, launch, implement, reset, or realize the Agent Native.
- **Workflow** — the ordered path from the Human's Target definition to running software: Define Target, Configure, Plan, Develop, Review, and Launch.
- **Workflow Path** — the Human's selected level of direct orchestration over that same Workflow: Default, Normal, or Detailed; it is an invocation style, not a State Mode.
- **Mode** — an operational position in the Workflow, recorded by State.
- **Skill** — an Agent capability that performs a Workflow action or provides a supporting utility; it is part of the Executor Module's integration surface, while its implementation remains outside `.interface/`.
- **Executor Module** — the Human-owned, Runtime-independent declaration of how an Agent Native and its Agent Instances must operate. Bare `Agent` is never used as a substitute for this term.
- **Runtime** — the execution environment that provides an Agent Native and its available native capabilities.
- **Agent Native** — the core operational Agent supplied by the selected Agent Runtime and currently responsible for receiving the Human's request, applying realized Executor Module behavior, and hosting or coordinating Agent Instances.
- **Agent Instance** — one primary or specialized executable identity operating within an Agent Native, with an assigned Agent Role and bounded capabilities. One Agent Native may expose several Agent Instances.
- **Executor Preferences** — the complete portable declaration of Executor Components and their current selections, resources, portable realization requirements, and validation expectations; Native-specific paths and formats are resolved by Agent Native Implement.
- **Agent Role** — one bounded execution responsibility within the Executor Preferences, including the primary role and specialized delegated roles.
- **Capability** — one declared Agent facility, such as a Skill, Rule, Command, Tool, Hook, Integration, or Extension, with an owning Component and bounded contract.
- **Agent Native Implement** — the Foundation instruction and Agent Skill `/my-interface-native-implement` that reads the Human-owned Executor Module and realizes it in the selected Agent Native; no other operation reads the Executor Module.
- **Capability Realization Kind** — how a declared Agent capability becomes usable in the active Native: **Constructed**, realized from the Executor Module and owning Operation Component; or **Installed**, supplied by an external provider and managed by the relevant Native mechanism.
