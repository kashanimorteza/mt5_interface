# Develop Definition

Develop is the Operation Component that executes authorized planned Tasks and produces the resulting Development work.

## Introduction

### Overview

It does not redefine the Plan or own the product meaning it realizes.

### Purpose

Planned work needs a bounded operation that turns Tasks into observable implementation results while preserving the authorities that made those Tasks understandable and verifiable.

### How It Works

Develop reads the current Plan for each selected phase and works through its eligible Tasks, recording evidence and progress in each Task's Task Log.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Terms --->
## Terms

- **Development Result** — the authorized Source, interface, configuration, or evidence produced by a completed development Task.
- **Task Evidence** — the observable information showing what a Develop operation produced.
- **Developable Phase** — an active Target phase whose required Config records are valid and whose current Plan exists.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Architecture --->
## Architecture

Develop owns Task execution. Technical choices and defaults belong to the owning Development Component Preferences; Plan owns the work definition, Development owns product meaning, Task Logs own Task evidence and progress, and State owns Operation Logs and aggregate progress.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Relationships --->
## Relationships

- **Consumes Plan** — takes the selected Groups, Tasks, context, dependencies, and completion conditions.
- **Consumes Interface and Target** — applies their current authorities while performing the selected Tasks.
- **Consumes Development authorities** — realizes the product under the Development Components' Definitions and Preferences.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Authority --->
## Authority

The Principles in this Definition govern Develop. Develop Preferences can supply execution defaults only where the Plan and owning Development authorities are silent.

## Principles

Every Principle below is mandatory.

### Execution

#### Develop executes planned work within its authority

**Rule:** Develop accepts one or more Target phase identifiers, or considers every active and developable Target phase when none is selected, in Target order. It establishes current Interface and Target Understanding, and starts only when required Config records are valid and the current Plan for each applicable phase exists. Develop executes only selected eligible Tasks whose authority, scope, inputs, outputs, and completion conditions are understood. It considers each Task's Task Skills and may use any other suitable available Skill.

Before changing a Task's result, Develop claims that eligible Task. It preserves valid existing work, records Task-specific evidence, progress transitions, and any Task-specific Blocker in the Task Log, and updates the Task status accordingly. A choice Develop makes on its own proposal is recorded as a decision in that Task's Task Log, and Develop's State Log Entry lists that Task under `decisions`. When a new Task identifies an earlier developed Task through `replaces`, Develop marks that earlier Task as `replaced` and records the relationship in its Task Log before executing the new Task. If Config or Plan is unavailable, Develop stops. If no eligible Task exists, it completes without changing implementation work. It stops when a dependency or prerequisite is unmet, verification fails, or an unresolved condition other than an unset choice prevents completion.
**Why:** Bounded execution keeps implementation traceable to the Plan and prevents an execution operation from becoming an unplanned design authority.
**Boundary:** Develop never changes Target meaning, Plan authority, Development Principles, or another Component's owned record without explicit authority. It does not design or change Tasks, and stops and reports when another Operation is required.

### Generation

These Principles hold for every Development Component Develop realizes. A Component's own Definition states what its conformance means; these state how generation reaches and proves it.

#### Generation writes only inside the Component it realizes

**Rule:** Develop generates, changes, documents, and removes artifacts only inside the Component a Task realizes. A Component's contract changes only under its own authorities, never because another Component's implementation lacks a capability.
**Why:** Independent ownership keeps each Component reusable and prevents one Component's work from rewriting another's contract.
**Boundary:** A Component may use the language and packages its own Preferences select; those are realization dependencies, not dependencies on another Component.

#### Generation and evolution are deterministic

**Rule:** Unchanged Target, Definition, Preferences, and resolved technical selections produce the same ordered Component output with no source or documentation difference. Regeneration classifies authoritative additions, modifications, explicit renames, and removals; updates every affected public surface together; preserves unaffected and still-declared meaning; removes only the Component's own obsolete output; and never infers rename or removal from name similarity, missing understanding, or generator limitation.
**Why:** Determinism makes reviews meaningful and protects existing meaning during evolution.
**Boundary:** Runtime-generated values are not source nondeterminism. Compatibility aliases or historical versions exist only when explicit authority requires them, and Develop owns no data migration.

#### Failure is explicit and atomic

**Rule:** Generation collects independent actionable failures when safe, identifies the affected item or artifact without exposing a sensitive value, and publishes only complete output. Failure preserves the last valid output and publishes no partial result. Develop checks nothing beyond completing its own output; conformance is established by the Review Operation.
**Why:** A failed generation must not look complete or destroy usable output.
**Boundary:** Warnings are limited to meaning-neutral issues; omission, coercion, fallback, invention, or partial publication never hides an error.

#### Generated source meets the selected technology standard

**Rule:** Generated output is written to the selected technology's standard. It declares only necessary dependencies, with concrete versions stabilized, and contains no dead, duplicate, incomplete, cached, compiled, machine-specific, Agent-identifying, timestamped, or narratively generated artifact. Whether it passes the technology's checks is established by the Review Operation.
**Why:** Correct meaning must be delivered as clean, usable source.
**Boundary:** Language-required technical artifacts do not create meaning.

## At a Glance

Every obligation in the file, under the Principle it comes from.

### Execution

**Develop executes planned work within its authority**

- **Must** — select one or more Target phases, or every active and developable phase when none is selected, in Target order.
- **Must** — require valid Config and a current Plan before development, and stop when either is absent.
- **Must** — execute only understood, claimed, eligible Tasks; consider their Task Skills and record Task evidence and progress in their Task Logs.
- **Must** — record every choice made on its own proposal as a decision in its Task Log and list that Task under `decisions` in State.
- **Must** — mark an earlier developed Task as `replaced` and record the relationship before executing a new Task that identifies it through `replaces`.
- **Never** — expand Task scope, or replace Target, Plan, or Development authority.

### Generation

**Generation writes only inside the Component it realizes**

- **Must** — change only the output of the Component a Task realizes.
- **Never** — change a Component's contract because another Component lacks a capability.

**Generation and evolution are deterministic**

- **Must** — produce zero diff from unchanged authorities and reconcile explicit changes across all affected surfaces.
- **Never** — guess a rename or removal, retain obsolete generated duplication, or own data migration.

**Failure is explicit and atomic**

- **Must** — report actionable non-secret failures and publish only complete output.
- **Never** — hide an error or replace the last valid output with partial output.

**Generated source meets the selected technology standard**

- **Must** — write output to the selected technology's standard with only necessary, version-stabilized dependencies.
- **Never** — emit unnecessary, dead, duplicate, cached, compiled, machine-specific, Agent-identifying, or timestamped output.
