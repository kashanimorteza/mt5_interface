## Introduction

### Overview

Review owns its Findings and the execution data that records what was reviewed. It does not own Plan or Target.

### Purpose

Review is the reader who does not hold the producer's intent. It takes the phase Plan as the planned baseline and judges the generated Source and evidence against it.

### How It Works

Review reads the current Plan for each selected phase, judges the generated Source against it, and records and resolves its Findings.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Terms --->
## Terms

- **Review** — one independent examination of one phase's Plan, generated Source, and evidence.
- **Source Understanding** — understanding the generated Source needed to examine the selected phase without reading unrelated Source.
- **Finding** — one specific way in which the result does not demonstrably satisfy what was asked, recorded with what was expected, what was observed, and where.
- **Evidence** — the exact location or observable result that supports a finding, so that a reader can see it without repeating the review.
- **Outcome** — the aggregate result: `satisfied` when the reviewed result satisfies the current Plan, or `not satisfied` otherwise.
- **Missing evidence** — an acceptance criterion for which nothing observable demonstrates that it holds.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Architecture --->
## Architecture

Review owns its Findings, review data, and the resolutions it can perform. Plan owns planned work and Develop owns implementation work outside Review's resolution scope.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Relationships --->
## Relationships

- **Consumes Plan and generated Source** — takes the Plan's coverage, acceptance criteria, and verification conditions as the baseline for examining the selected phase's Source and evidence.
- **Consumes State** — uses current aggregate progress and prior Review Log Entries without treating either as authority, and records its outcome and Findings through State.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Authority --->
## Authority

The Principles in this Definition govern Review. Review Preferences cannot lower the evidence or independence required by those Principles.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Principles --->
## Principles

Every Principle below is mandatory.

<br>

### Review examines Source against the current Plan

**Rule:** A Review accepts one or more Target phase identifiers, or considers every phase when none is selected. It starts only when the required Config records are valid. Once generated Source is available for a phase, whether or not Development has completed, it establishes Source Understanding within that phase's scope. It reads the current Plan, then judges the generated Source, Public Interface, implemented result, and evidence against that Plan. It stops when the required result or evidence is unavailable, an authority cannot be established, or an unresolved condition prevents assurance.

**Why:** A result can only be judged against the work that was planned for it. Judging it against what the implementer intended, or against what a reviewer would have built, measures the wrong thing.

**Boundary:** Review does not define new requirements or change Plan content. Work newly required by Target belongs to Planning. Silence in the Plan is not a licence to supply a missing requirement and then find the result wanting.

<br>

### Review records, resolves, and rechecks its findings

**Rule:** Review records its Findings in its execution data, then updates those same Finding records when it resolves them. A Finding that cannot be resolved is recorded in `open_questions` or `blockers` and prevents further review work on that unresolved condition.

**Why:** Recording the Finding before resolving it preserves the original observation while allowing Review to close the loop and verify the result.

**Boundary:** Review may change only the reviewed implementation and the evidence needed to resolve one of its recorded Findings. It never changes Target meaning, Plan content, Task status, or any other Operation's owned record.

<br>

### Review is independent of how the work was done

**Rule:** Review observes the required condition for itself. It may read the check the implementer built and the evidence it recorded, but it judges whether that check actually establishes the condition rather than accepting that it passed.

**Why:** The same operation wrote the code and the check that proves it, so a check shaped around the implementation will pass whatever the implementation happens to do. Independence is the whole reason Review exists.

**Boundary:** Independence is about the judgment, not about the sources. Review uses the phase Plan and the generated Source it examines; it does not invent a different standard.

<br>

### Every Finding is grounded in an observation

**Rule:** A Finding states what was expected, what was observed, and the exact location or observable result that shows it. A statement that cannot be traced to something a reader can see for themselves is not a Finding.

**Why:** A Finding is a claim about the project that someone will act on. Grounding it in an observation is what lets the human check it instead of trusting it.

**Boundary:** A concern that cannot be observed may still be worth saying, but it is said as an observation about the review itself, not recorded as a Finding.

<br>

### Missing evidence is a Finding, not an absence

**Rule:** When an acceptance criterion has nothing observable to demonstrate it, that is recorded as a Finding of its own. Review does not reconstruct the missing evidence, infer it from the implementation, or treat a plausible result as proof that a check once passed.

**Why:** Unproven and proven look identical in a record that only lists failures, and the difference between them is exactly what a review is for.

**Boundary:** Missing evidence describes what the record does not show. It is not a claim that the requirement is unmet, and it is not resolved by the implementer explaining what they did.

<br>

### A Finding outlives the session that raised it

**Rule:** Every Finding is stored in the Review execution's State Log `data` and remains traceable through that execution's Entry. Its state is updated in that Entry's data when it is resolved or left open.

**Why:** A finding reported only in conversation is gone when the session ends, and the next run has no way to know it was ever raised. A stored finding is the only thing that makes the second review of a phase worth more than the first.

**Boundary:** Review records its Findings, resolutions, and aggregate outcome in its State Log Entries. It does not reopen Tasks or change Plan content.

<br>

### Review checks every Component against its Review category

**Rule:** For each phase, Review also reads the `Review` category of every Development Component the phase realizes and checks each of its observations, in addition to judging the result against the current Plan. A Task's acceptance and a Component's Review category are both baselines: a result that fails either is a Finding, and a Task's acceptance holds only once Review has established it.

**Why:** Plan and Develop check nothing. A Component's Review category states what makes that Component correct whatever a particular Plan contained, so this is where its correctness is established.

**Boundary:** Review applies each Component's Review category as that Component states it; it does not add observations the Component does not name.

<br>

### Review establishes technical and repeatable conformance

**Rule:** Review validates the generation inputs — completeness, uniqueness, compatibility, naming, reference resolution, and technology support — and verifies that generated output is installable and importable, passes the selected technology's format, import, compile, build, lint, static type, dependency, and runtime checks without a fixable warning owned by the Component, and that regeneration from unchanged authorities produces no source or documentation difference. The applicable testing authority determines whether the evidence is persisted or transient: disabled persistent testing requires transient verification rather than skipping it, and Review never widens the declared testing scope.

**Why:** A result that does not build, or that changes on every generation, cannot be trusted whatever its meaning.

**Boundary:** Verification observes and rejects mismatch; resolving a Finding never repairs ambiguity by invention or changes another Component.
