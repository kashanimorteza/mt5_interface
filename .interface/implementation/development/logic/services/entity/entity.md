# Entity Service Definition

Entity Service is the fixed internal Logic Service whose Interface gives every Entity published by Model one Child Service that works directly through Database Interface.

## Introduction

### Overview

Entity Service is a fixed internal Service of every Logic Component. For every Entity in Model's Entity Collection it provides one Child Service, so a caller selects an Entity once and then calls its Actions without passing the Entity again. Its Interface publishes Service, the Child Services; Model, the Entity each binds; and, unchanged, three of the groups Database Interface publishes.

### Purpose

Database takes the Entity on every request. Entity Service binds that Entity once per Child Service and gives each Entity one place for Behavior of its own.

### How It Works

A caller selects a Child Service and calls an Action; the Child Service adds its bound Entity to the request and hands it to Database, then returns Database's answer unchanged.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Terms --->
## Terms

- **Entity Role** — the fixed identity of this Service inside Logic, independent of its configurable name.
- **Base** — the one shared structure that holds every Action and that every Child Service inherits.
- **Child Service** — the structure bound to one Entity of Model's Entity Collection.
- **Action** — one operation of Base, named and shaped exactly like one Entity Operation of Database's Interface group, without the Entity class.
- **Interface contract** — the versioned public contract of Entity Service Interface, stated in its Architecture section, with its version in Entity Service Preferences.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Architecture --->
## Architecture

```text

```

Every entity below is declared in `architecture` in Entity Service Preferences, which also own the configurable name, naming patterns, language, realization, and documentation choices; these selections realize the responsibilities below without changing them.

<!-------------------------- Interface -->
### Interface

```text
Interface
├── Service
├── Model
├── database_value
├── database_instance
└── database_error
```

The gateway callers import from, in its own `interface` file, the only file of Entity Service that publishes: everything a caller needs to call Actions, build requests, read results, and catch errors without importing Model or Database. It publishes its own two groups, Service and Model, named in Entity Service Preferences, and three Database groups, and nothing else. Its Interface contract is these needs, with `contract_version` in Entity Service Preferences:

1. **Service** — exactly one Child Service for every Entity in Model's Entity Collection, changing when the Collection changes.
2. **Model** — the Entity every Child Service binds, under the same name as its Child Service, as the original object Model Interface publishes, never a copy, so no caller has to reach Model directly.
3. **Database groups** — Database's Value, Instance, and Error groups, `database_value`, `database_instance`, and `database_error`, each passed on under its own name as the identical object, never a copy or a member taken out on its own, and read from Database Interface each time rather than listed by hand.
4. **Nothing else** — Base, Database's Interface, Setup, and Result groups, and anything beyond these groups are never published; Interface runs no check, and loading it opens no connection and creates no data or file.
5. **Versioned** — changing this structure requires raising `contract_version` and a consumer review; a change in Model's Entity Collection or in what Database Interface publishes flows through without one.

For example, a caller creates `Service.User()`, calls `add` with a `Model.User`, filters `list` with a `database_value.Filter` on `Model.User.is_active`, and catches `database_error.InvalidInputError` when it passes a `Model.Account` instead.

<!-------------------------- Base -->
### Base

The layer that holds the one shared structure, in one unit, and every Action:

- **Creation** — Base creates one object of Database's Interface group, and every Action uses that same object.
- **Mirror** — one Action for every Entity Operation of that group, in the order Database publishes them, with the Operation's name and no prefix, and its parameters' names, order, and defaults; a parameter taking the Entity class is removed and supplied from the bound Entity, and a parameter taking an Entity instance stays. Command Operations take no Entity and are not part of Base.
- **Forwarding** — each Action passes every other argument unchanged and returns Database's answer and errors unchanged.
- **Bound Entity** — an instance that is not of the bound Entity is rejected with Database's Invalid Input error before Database is called.
- **Explicit** — Base writes every Action out as its own method; no Action is forwarded through a generic or dynamic dispatcher or produced at runtime.
- **Source** — Base reads only what Database Interface publishes, located from Database's own Preferences, never Database's structure files.

### Entities

```text
Entities
└── one Child Service per Entity
```

The layer that holds one unit and one Child Service for every Entity in Model's Entity Collection, each unit placed directly in the Entity Service directory beside `interface` and `base`, never in a sub-directory. Each Child Service inherits Base, binds its own Entity, and holds only Behavior or Actions specific to that Entity: it may add an Action, override a Base Action, or override one to make it unavailable for its Entity. Their unit and structure names follow the Child naming patterns in Entity Service Preferences, and an override of a Base Action applies to its own Entity only.

The documentation of Entity Service, in the file, location, and format Entity Service Preferences name. Its sections, in this order:

1. **Overview** — What Entity Service is and why it exists, in one paragraph, with one simple example.
2. **Interface** — Every group with its members — every Child Service and its Actions, every Model, and every member of the three Database groups — each with one example.
3. **Use** — How a caller imports a Child Service and how a Child Service adds its own Behavior.

### Directory Structure

```text
Directory Structure
├── interface
├── base

The root of this tree is the Entity Service directory, named in `settings` in Entity Service Preferences. It holds one unit per Entity directly beside `interface` and `base`, named by the Child naming pattern; there is no Entity sub-directory.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Relationships --->
## Relationships

- **Consumes Model** — uses the Entity Collection Model Interface publishes to know which Child Services exist, and each Entity it publishes by name to bind one, found from Model's own Preferences.
- **Consumes Database** — uses every Entity Operation of Database's Interface group and Database's Value, Instance, and Error groups, only through Database Interface, found from Database's own Preferences.
- **Consumes Development** — follows its shared rules and Defaults for every choice this Component leaves unstated.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Boundaries --->
## Boundaries

- **Entity meaning and declarations** — are not Entity Service's, because it binds Entities without defining them.
- **Persistence and Instance selection** — are not Entity Service's, because it only requests Database's Entity Operations.
- **Actions that take no Entity** — are not Entity Service's, because a Child Service is bound to one Entity.
- **Publishing Services from Logic's root** — is not Entity Service's, because it owns only its own Interface.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Authority --->
## Authority

Every Principle in this file is mandatory for Entity Service. Entity Service Preferences provide configurable defaults and conventions but can never weaken a Principle. Explicit Target meaning and applicable Logic Principles retain their authority.

<br>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Principles --->
## Principles

Every Principle below is mandatory and belongs to the category that owns it.

### General

#### Entity Service is fixed and internal

**Rule:** Every Logic contains the fixed Entity Role and its Interface. Its configured name may change, but its Role and responsibilities do not. Its implementation remains internal in every case.
**Why:** Entity-oriented access needs one stable gateway without exposing shared or child implementation.
**Boundary:** Base and Database internals are never exposed.

### Interface

#### Entity Service Interface conforms to the Interface contract

**Rule:** Every realization of Entity Service Interface conforms to the versioned Interface contract, which fixes its groups, the Actions of every Child Service, and what it never publishes.
**Why:** Every caller depends on one exact gateway instead of reinterpreting each realization.
**Boundary:** Changing the structure itself requires raising `contract_version`.

#### Entity Service names are valid and unique

**Rule:** The configured Service name, the Base name, the Service and Model group names, and every Child Service unit and structure name derived from the configured patterns are valid for the selected language and never collide within the same group. A Child Service and its Model share one name by design.
**Why:** Every Entity needs an unambiguous realization that the selected language accepts.
**Boundary:** An invalid, reserved, or colliding value stops generation with a clear configuration error. The generator never invents a suffix, number, or silent rename.

### Base

#### Base mirrors every Entity Operation of Database

**Rule:** Base has exactly one Action for every Entity Operation of Database's Interface group, in Database's order, with the same name and parameters except the removed Entity class. Every Action is written out as its own method; none is forwarded through a generic or dynamic dispatcher. No Action is named or listed by hand.
**Why:** Base follows Database one to one, so whoever knows Database already knows every Child Service.
**Boundary:** An Operation that takes no Entity never becomes an Action.

#### Every Action works only through Database Interface

**Rule:** Every Action calls its Database Operation through Database Interface, using the one Database object Base created, and returns its answer and errors unchanged, adding no behavior of its own.
**Why:** One route keeps every Action a faithful mirror of Database and keeps persistence out of Entity Service.
**Boundary:** An Action never reaches a Database implementation detail.

#### Every Action keeps to its bound Entity

**Rule:** An Action that takes an Entity instance rejects an instance that is not of the bound Entity with Database's Invalid Input error, before calling Database.
**Why:** Selecting a Child Service must reliably select the Entity the Action works on.
**Boundary:** This checks Entity identity only; it never checks Field values.

### Entities

#### Every Entity has exactly one Child Service

**Rule:** Entity Service has exactly one Child Service for every Entity in Model's Entity Collection. Each binds its own Entity and inherits Base.
**Why:** The Child Services stay complete and in step with Model.
**Boundary:** A Child Service never copies or redefines its Entity.

#### A Child Service holds only what is its own

**Rule:** A Child Service inherits Base and holds only Behavior or Actions specific to its Entity; everything shared comes from Base.
**Why:** Shared Actions are written once and cannot drift between Entities.
**Boundary:** A Child Service may add an Action, override a Base Action, or override one to make it unavailable, for its own Entity only, but never detaches itself from Base.

### Review

#### Entity conformance covers every Entity contract

**Rule:** Entity Service is conformant only when its Interface contract and its real Interface match one another.
**Why:** A gap or a change here silently breaks every caller of Entity Service.
**Boundary:** Review reads Model and Database Interfaces only to compare; it changes nothing outside Entity Service.

#### Review observes Entity Service through a fixed set of checks

**Rule:** Review establishes Entity conformance through these observations, every one of them on every review:
- Entity Service Interface publishes exactly Service, with one Child Service for every Entity in Model's Entity Collection; Model, with the Entity each Child Service binds under the same name; and Database's Value, Instance, and Error groups; and nothing else.
- Every object in Model and every republished group is the identical object its source Interface publishes.
- Base has exactly one Action for every Entity Operation of Database's Interface group, in Database's order, with the same name, each written out as its own method and none produced by a generic or dynamic dispatcher.
- Each Action has its Operation's parameter names, order, and defaults, without the Entity class parameter.
- Each Action returns its Operation's result and raises its errors unchanged, and rejects an instance of another Entity with the Invalid Input error.
- Every Action uses the one Database object Base holds, and adds no validation, retry, or Instance selection of its own.
- Every Child Service unit and structure name follows the configured patterns, and every name is valid and unique.
- Every Child Service binds exactly its own Entity, inherits Base, and sits in its own unit directly in the Entity Service directory.
- Loading the Interface opens no connection and creates no data or file.
**Why:** A fixed set of observations proves the same things on every review, so a result is never judged by a different standard from one run to the next.
**Boundary:** Each observation states what is seen, never the command, tool, or code that observes it; how it is realized belongs to the Review Operation.
